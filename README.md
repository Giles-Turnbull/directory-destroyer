<h1>Description</h1>

When this program is run, it allows a user to input a desired file path (for example C:/) and a number of files.

It will then create a the desired number of files in every folder within the given file path. The creation date, modification date, file name, type, and size are all spoofed so the user can only delete them individually.<br><br>
